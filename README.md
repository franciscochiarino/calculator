# Calculator

A simple calculator to be added to the macintosh-1984 project. 

## Step by step thinking

1. At the beginning (when there is nothing shown in the display) the calculator is only going to display numbers when we press them.

2. When we press an operator, the calc. will first make sure that there is a number in the desplay. If there is a number, and no other operator displayed, then the operator is also going to be displayed.

3. Then the user would be able to choose another number.

4. Once the whole operation is desplayed (example => a + b), the user would either press 'C', '=' or another operator. 
  - If the user presses 'C', everything in the display will be gone. 
  - If he/she presses '=', the calc. would display the result. 
  - If another operator, then the calc. would run the operation, display the result, and add the pressed operator at the end (exaple => display shows 'a + b' => user presses '+' => display shows 'c +').
